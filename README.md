# Spring Boot / Angular Fullstack Training

This project is a comprehensive hands-on training based on **24 practical workshops**, each focusing on specific educational objectives. By the end of this training, participants will be able to:

## ✨ Objectives

### Spring Boot:

- Develop Model, Persistence and Service layers of a backend application
- Persist and query data using Spring Data JPA
- Build RESTful web services
- Understand and implement the DTO (Data Transfer Object) design pattern
- Secure APIs using JWT tokens
- Integrate user authentication using GitHub and Keycloak

### Angular:

- Understand Angular project structure and create projects
- Use all types of Data Binding: String Interpolation, Property Binding, Event Binding and Two-Way Binding
- Create web components, use Bootstrap, and configure routing
- Build and manage forms for product CRUD operations
- Handle associations between model classes and dropdown lists
- Consume REST APIs using HttpClient and Spring Data REST
- Develop search interfaces using keyup events, pipes, and filters
- Use @Input and @Output decorators to transfer data between components
- Secure UI interfaces based on user roles
- Integrate Angular with Spring Boot secured APIs via JWT
- Handle user registration and image management

---

## 📂 Workshop Content

The training covers fullstack development with a progressive and practical approach. The backend part begins with creating the data model and setting up persistence with Spring Data JPA. Then, you'll expose data via RESTful web services, apply DTOs for optimized data transfer, and progressively secure the APIs using JWT and OAuth2 with Keycloak.

On the frontend side, you’ll learn to set up Angular projects, master data binding, create dynamic forms, manage components communication, and secure access based on user roles. You'll also learn how to consume secured APIs, perform CRUD operations, and enhance the UI with Bootstrap.

By the end, you'll also have implemented user registration, image upload/download, and social login integration.

## ⚙️ Technologies

- **Backend**: Java, Spring Boot, Spring Security, Spring Data JPA, JWT, OAuth2, Keycloak
- **Frontend**: Angular, TypeScript, Bootstrap
- **Tools**: Git, Maven, Postman, VS Code, STS (Spring Tool Suite)

## 🚀 How to Run

### Backend (Spring Boot)

```bash
cd backend
./mvnw spring-boot:run
```

### Frontend (Angular)

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
ng serve
```

=======
# MesProduits

This project was generated using [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 19.2.8.

## Development server

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
ng serve
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Angular CLI includes powerful code scaffolding tools. To generate a new component, run:

```bash
ng generate component component-name
```

For a complete list of available schematics (such as `components`, `directives`, or `pipes`), run:

```bash
ng generate --help
```

## Building

To build the project run:

```bash
ng build
```

This will compile your project and store the build artifacts in the `dist/` directory. By default, the production build optimizes your application for performance and speed.

## Running unit tests

To execute unit tests with the [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io) test runner, use the following command:

```bash
ng test
```

## Running end-to-end tests

For end-to-end (e2e) testing, run:

```bash
ng e2e
```

Angular CLI does not come with an end-to-end testing framework by default. You can choose one that suits your needs.
